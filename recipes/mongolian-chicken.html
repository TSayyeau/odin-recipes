  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is like the sister dish to sweet and sour chicken but without the sour tangy flavour. Instead, the sauce is a garlic brown sugar hoisin sauce with a kick from the red chili. It is not overly spicy where you need a tall glass of milk to fan the flames but you can feel that spice at the back of your tongue. A dish to try if you love sweet spicy chicken. If youâ€™re not a fan of spice, feel free to omit the red chili.</p>
